## Mongock Migration [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leonardo-mendes/mongockMigration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leonardo-mendes/mongockMigration)
It's a simple application to test [mongock](https://github.com/cloudyrock/mongock) as a migration tool for MongoDb.

Schema migration (also database migration, database change management) refers to the management of incremental, reversible changes and version control to schemas. A schema migration is performed on a database whenever it is necessary to update or revert that database's schema to some newer or older version.
